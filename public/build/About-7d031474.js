It has survived not only five centuries, but\n      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially\n      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset\n      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop\n      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem\n      Ipsum.";

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney\n      College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,\n      consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of\n      the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem\n      Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et\n      Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This\n      book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the\n      Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit\n      amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.";

The point of using\n      Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,\n      as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like\n      readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors\n      now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem\n      ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various\n      versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on\n      purpose (injected humour and the like).";

If you are\n      going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't\n      anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum\n      generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,\n      making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary\n      of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence\n      structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated\n      Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or\n      non-characteristic words etc.";
